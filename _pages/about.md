I am a second-year Computer Science PhD Student at Northeastern University, where I am advised by [Jonathan Ullman](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jullman/) and [Alina Oprea](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/alina/). I completed my B.S. in Pure Mathematics at Florida State Univerity and completed my undergaduate thesis under the guidance of [Alec Kercheval](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~kercheva/) and [Nathan Crock](https://www.sc.fsu.edu/people?uid=ndc08).

My academic interests generally lie within the intersection of theoretical computer science and machine learning. I am also interested in differential privacy within the context of deep learning, adversarial machine learning, and the social implications of machine learning algorithms.

I have also held several industry positions in both software engineering and data science. During the summers of 2020 and 2021, I worked as an iOS Software Engineer intern at [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/), where I helped create new applications and features for multiple products in the [QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/) ecosystem. Throughout my last 2 years at Florida State, I interned at [NewSci Labs](https://labs.newsci.ai/), where I worked on several machine learning and computer vision projects.
