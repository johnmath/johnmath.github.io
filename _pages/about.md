I am a fourth-year Computer Science PhD Student at Northeastern University, where I am advised by [Jonathan Ullman](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jullman/) and [Alina Oprea](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/alina/). I completed my B.S. in Pure Mathematics at Florida State University and conducted my undergraduate honors thesis under the guidance of [Alec Kercheval](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~kercheva/) and [Nathan Crock](https://www.sc.fsu.edu/people?uid=ndc08).

My primary research interest is privacy in deep learning. More broadly, I am interested in both theoretical computer science and applied machine learning, including topics such as differential privacy, adversarial machine learning, and the trustworthiness of machine learning algorithms.

I have also held industry positions in both software engineering and data science at [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/) and [NewSci Labs](https://labs.newsci.ai/), respectively. During the summers of 2023 and 2024, I was an Applied Research Intern on [LinkedIn's](https://about.linkedin.com/) Data Privacy team, where I worked on empirically measuring privacy leakage in analytics and LLMs. This semester, I am a Student Researcher at [Google](https://about.google/), exploring open problems in machine unlearning ðŸ”’
